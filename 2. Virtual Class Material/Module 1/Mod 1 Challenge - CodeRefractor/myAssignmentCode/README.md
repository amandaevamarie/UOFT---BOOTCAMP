# Code Refactor Starter Code - User Story

* As a marketing agency, I want a codebase that follows accessibility standard so that our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria 

* My webpage meets accessibility standards when I view the source code and find semantic HTML elements and find accesible alt attributes in the image elements

* When I view the structure of the HTML elements, I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

* When I view the heading attributes they fall in sequential order when I view the title element I find a concise, descriptive title
