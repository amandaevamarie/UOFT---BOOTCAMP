Be patient. I consider myself a patient person, but only when it comes to matters outside of the self. I often find my patient is tested when having to be patient with myself when learning new things. If I don't understand it right away or have a base understanding - I get frustrated and push harder to understand to prove to myself I can learn it. This is an inefficient way of learning because it can cause burnout, and in my experience, has caused burnout. I have been aware of this challenge even prior to starting this bootcamp and work daily on overcoming this behaviour I display when learning new things. And my approach to overcoming this was learning more abot growth mindset and shifting my perspective from disliking failure to welcoming it. Two things I do is tell myself, I may not know it now but with time I will - and give myself breaks, step away and come back to the issue/topic/problem. The second thing I do is put myself in as many opoprtunities to struggle and fail. It is uncomfortable but I have found this discomfort has decreased overtime. Once extremely unbearable, now a balance of uncomfortable but exciting.   



Team up. I have found I struggle with collaborative work. I do have anxiety when it comes to social situations and enjoy independent work because of this. This challenge is one I have been trying to overcome for years. I still find it very difficult to find a level of comfort in situations where there is collaboration especially if I find that no  time to make some form of connection or if no interest is there. To over come this, I have worked on trying to engage in more small talk. For a very long time, I disliked small talk but came to realize it is a great catalyst for comfort in social situations. Perfecting the art of small talk and be useful in overcoming social situations. Still working on it though.
